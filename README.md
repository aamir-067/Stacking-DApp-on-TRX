# Nile Test Network DApp README


This decentralized application (DApp) is deployed on the Tron test network known as Nile. It leverages technologies such as React.js, Solidity, and Tailwind CSS for its development. Additionally, several libraries including tronWeb.js, TronBox, and TronLink wallet were utilized to facilitate interaction with the Tron network and smart contracts.


## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Front-end user interface development.
- **redux-toolkit**: for managing the states of the application.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract development language for the Tron blockchain.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework for the user interface.
- **Sheryjs**: for animations and mousefollower
- **js-cookies**: to store temporary javascript cookies.
- **tronWeb.js**: Library for interacting with smart contracts on the Tron network.
- **TronBox**: Tool used for deploying contracts on the blockchain.
- **TronLink Wallet**: Tron-compatible wallet for transactions and interactions.


## DApp Functionality

The functionality of this DApp is straightforward. Users are required to deposit testnet Tron into the contract, allowing them to generate another token as a reward. The mechanism governing the reward system is based on a simple principle: for every unit of testnet Tron deposited, users will receive one token of TKN. The allocation of tokens occurs at regular intervals of 5 minutes.

## How to Use the DApp
1. **Connect Wallet**: Ensure you have TronLink wallet installed and connected.
2. **Deposit TRX**: Deposit testnet Tron into the contract.
3. **Token Generation**: Tokens (TKN) will be generated based on the amount of TRX deposited, following the described reward mechanism.
